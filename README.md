# Rodrigo Silveira: Rokko WP Theme

http://www.rodrigo-silveira.com

Just another WordPress theme... my intention was to have a techie look and feel, since that's what my portfolio/blog is all about. 

Uses Twitter Bootstrap 3 to help with full responsiveness, as well as cool components and widgets out of the box.

## To do

* make category and serps pages like blog roll template
* article view
   * display tags
* update articles
   * date
   * category
   * keywords
   * normalize thumbnails (3x9 ?)
* add responsive iframe css
```css
.responsiveIframe  {
    float: none;
    clear: both;
    width: 100%;
    position: relative;
    padding-bottom: 56.25%;
    padding-top: 25px;
    height: 0;
}

.responsiveIframe  iframe {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}
```
